# Active-Noise-Cancellation
Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is a method for reducing undesired noise. ANC is achieved by introducing a canceling antinoise wave through secondary sources. These secondary sources are interconnected through an electronic system using a specific signal processing algorithm for the particular cancellation scheme. The project is to write an algorithm in matlab for single channel feed-forward active noise control system based on the FxLMS. This report will demonstrate the approaches that we take on tackling the noise cancellation effects, along with results comparison.
